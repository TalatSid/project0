Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

I have developed a 4 page website to show my current are of interest. 

The initial page serves as a window to my personality and the idea of a tool I feel I need right now with toggles between pages. The second Page titled by my name provides an external link to my LinkedIn page. 

I used bootstrap to align the images on first page side by side, although I could do better in sizing them.  

I used a style sheet with multiple selectors. 

I had missed creating the sass file originally. I created one at the last min just for the purpose of demostration
