    <h1>Special needs? Mm mmm Gifted perhaps</h1>
    <p>I do not agree with the term "Special needs" when one is speaking about kids with varying developmental abilities or what is described as being on Spectrum, just because he/she thinks/processes/analyzes differently. When a kid performs academically better than his or her peers the kid gets the "gifted" title. I think all the kids should have thal lable to redefine norm. The focus in the (currently segregated) two cases is customized developmental plan in the areas of excellence or need. </p>
    <p> Below is a comparison of how the two groups are studied, there by enabling, if I may go as far as to say "discriminated"</p>
